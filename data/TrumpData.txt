Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing are totally in the Hillary circle of bias Think about Bill

Why isn t using the much newer Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll CNN even better
and very dishonest in not showing the new Poll where I am at 39 21points higher than Cruz Be honest Chuck
Why didn t you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video Bad reporting Perhaps will do better next year but doubt it
Great job on today Very wise indeed

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally Politics
When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it Never
just announced that TRUMP was 1 story of 2015 Totally meaningless however if we don t WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again
is so dishonest in his reporting and to think he was going off the air until I came along no ratings I will beat Hillary
The same people that said I wouldn t run or that I wouldn t lead or do well 1st place and leading by 21 now say I won t beat Hillary
Criminal deportations in the U S are the lowest number in many years We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country MUST CHANGE
MakeAmericaGreatAgain Trump2016 Story
Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate
I will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do no strength stamina
It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters BAD
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory The Dems LOVE IT Be smart and win for a change
who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high Lie
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late Stupid RNC
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia s Republican Party FAST
If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women s card on me she s wrong

Hillary Clinton doesn t have the strength or stamina to be president Jeb Bush is a low energy individual but Hillary is not much better
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women s issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware the candidates are mere puppets

Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form Very low interest loans scam
By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing unfairness while raising 6000000 for VETS
Great job on tonight begged us for a job We said no and she went hostile A real dummy

Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women Can t believe she would misrepresent the facts My hit was on China
Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U S political history
Crooked Hillary can t close the deal with Bernie Sanders Will be another bad day for her
Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy If so he should runnot her Will he bring the energizer to D C
How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA the worst economic deal in U S history
Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal If she can t win Kentucky she should drop out of race System rigged
Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud just like Crooked Hillary Their main line had nothing to do with women and they knew it Apologize

Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential I don t think so Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back ISIS LAUGHS

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya She is reckless and dangerous
Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom Wrong
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad Would be four more years of stupidity
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women
Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500 increase in Syrian refugees We can t allow this Time to get smart and protect America

Is Hillary really protecting women
Obama s VA Secretary just said we shouldn t measurewait times Hillary says VA problems are not widespread I will take care ofour vets
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups
Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn t care about jobs Most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement
A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary Read it amp you will never be able to vote for her Klein
Thank you Washington Trump2016 MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native American is a lowlife
Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes known as Pocahontas bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing Total hypocrite
Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren has done less in the U S Senate than practically any other senator All talk no action
Crooked Hillary Clinton just can t close the deal with Bernie I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates Hillary doesn t have it
The Inspector General s report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W H
I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard

They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story found zero proof so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story Nice
You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history led by some very bad and conflicted people MAGA
Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at but my non dealings are
After 7 months of investigations amp committee hearings about my collusion with the Russians nobody has been able to show any proof Sad
The Fake News Media hates when I use what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media over 100 million people I can go around them

Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump amp Russia
By the way if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election it all took place during the Obama Admin Why didn t they stop them
I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out That would be very bad for the Republican Party and please let Cryin Chuck stay
Together we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AmericaFirst
Just out The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia Did nothing about it WHY
Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums amp deductibles increase by over 100 Remember keep your doctor keep your plan
Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling why no action Focus on them not T
Obama Administration official said they choked when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election They didn t want to hurt Hillary
I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer
Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders Is she allowed to so collude Unfair to Bernie
The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas All they do is delay and complain They own ObamaCare
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win
and did not want to rock the boat He didn t choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling With 4 months looking at Russia
Republican Senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the Democrats Not easy Perhaps just let OCare crash amp burn
Very grateful for the 9 O decision from the U S Supreme Court We must keep America SAFE

I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare They really want to get it right unlike OCare

As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold Democrats and Russians
It s very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President
If Republicans don t Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand
Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer it s actually much worse than anyone ever thought and it begins with the Fake News
After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found Chuck Schumer just stated that Democrats should blame ourselvesnot Russia
So why aren t the Committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered A G looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes amp Russia relations
Sleazy Adam Schiff the totally biased Congressman looking into Russia spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse
Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal amp Replace after years of talking amp campaigning on it
Any senator who votes against starting debate is telling America that you are fine w the OCareNightmare Remarks

One of the things that has been lost in the politics of this situation is that the Russians collected and spread negative information about then candidate Trump Catherine Herridge So why doesn t Fake News report this Witch Hunt Purposely phony reporting
Go Republican Senators Go Get there after waiting for 7 years Give America great healthcare
3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down As I said from the beginning let ObamaCare implode then deal Watch
If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority not senseless 60
I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff He is a Great American
In other words Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election and why not I want strong military amp low oil prices Witch Hunt
Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW It is killing the R Party allows 8 Dems to control country 200 Bills sit in Senate A JOKE
Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don t go to a 51 vote majority NOW They look like fools and are just wasting time
8 Dems totally control the U S Senate Many great Republican bills will never pass like Kate s Law and complete Healthcare Get smart
If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute They are laughing at R s MAKE CHANGE
Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters Repeal amp Replace is not dead Demand another vote before voting on any other bill

Another false story this time in the Failing that I watch 4 8 hours of television a day Wrong Also I seldom if ever watch CNN or MSNBC both of which I consider Fake News I never watch Don Lemon who I once called the dumbest man on television Bad Reporting

While the Fake News loves to talk about my so called low approval rating just showed that my rating on Dec 28 2017 was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec 28 2009 which was 47 and this despite massive negative Trump coverage amp Russia hoax
The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration amp ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc We must protect our Country at all cost
On Taxes This is the biggest corporate rate cut ever going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago This is a huge pro growth stimulus for the economy Every year the Obama WH overstated how the economy would grow Now real economics and jobs Report
I use Social Media not because I like to but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair press now often referred to as Fake News Media Phony and non existent sources are being used more often than ever Many stories amp reports a pure fiction
Big protests in Iran The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism Looks like they will not take it any longer The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations

It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case such as DACA always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump Russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace Must have tough Primary
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion amp yet on and on it goes Russia amp the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing Republicans should finally take control
Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4000 JOBS and investing 1 6 BILLION in Alabama helping to further grow our economy

Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts only to build a new one in an off location for 1 2 billion dollars Bad deal Wanted me to cut ribbon NO
The so called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards Wall was not properly funded Chain amp Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime
Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards The Dems will threaten shutdown but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST

I don t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA They are all talk and no action This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have Too bad
So much Fake News is being reported They don t even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election
DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don t really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military
I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT No more Lotteries AMERICA FIRST

The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now No more dangerous Lottery

This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present DemocratShutdown
For those asking the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate and they need 60 That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election We can then be even tougher on Crime and Border and even better to our Military amp Veterans

Rep Lou Barletta a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a FANTASTIC Senator He is strong amp smart loves Pennsylvania amp loves our Country Voted for Tax Cuts unlike Bob Casey who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer

Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the Democrats After many years we have taken care of our Military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more Bipartisan make deal Dems
Negotiations on DACA have begun Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal Wouldn t it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the DACA puzzle This will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity March 5th
As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African Americans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all Proclamation
Today I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate as well as members of my Cabinet to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America s depleted infrastructure
My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school
While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA
The Schumer Rounds Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in America It creates a giant amnesty including for dangerous criminals doesn t build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa
Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland Florida
Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats totally abandoned Republicans are still working hard
Russia started their anti US campaign in 2014 long before I announced that I would run for President The results of the election were not impacted The Trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion
Charges Deal Don A Big Win written by Michael Goodwin of the succinctly states that the Russians had no impact on the election results There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign She lost the old fashioned way by being a terrible candidate Case closed
Deputy A G Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election
Funny how the Fake News Media doesn t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn t know
The Fake News Media never fails Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads Rob Goldman
I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was NOT the main goal Rob GoldmanVice President of Facebook Ads
Just like they don t want to solve the DACA problem why didn t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House amp Senate during the Obama Administration Because they didn t want to and now they just talk
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter This is not acceptable They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign there is no collusion Get back to the basics and make us all proud
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company
Finally Liddle Adam Schiff the leakin monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election He is finally right about something Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing Thank you Adam
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer The Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia it never did
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election But wasn t I a great candidate
If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the U S then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams They are laughing their asses off in Moscow Get smart America
The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN
Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot Big gain over last 4 weeks I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away We need more Republicans
Thank you to KenStarr former Independent Counsel Whitewater for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse Russian meddling etc Really great interview with

Obama was President up to and beyond the 2016 Election So why didn t he do something about Russian meddling
Thank you to for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more We are now starting to win again
There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America s elections there s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so I d invite Mr Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes
The President Obama quote just before election That s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn t want to rock the boat When I easily won the Electoral College the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems
Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially Also they want to do nothing on DACA R s want to fix
Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House You ve come a long way Matt
Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new pushed Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary Your Original was correct Don t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes amp waste money

cameras running Another False Accusation Why doesn t report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me One had her home mortgage paid off Only so reported doesn t fit the Mainstream Media narrative
Bad ratings amp got scammed when they covered the anti Trump Russia rally wall to wall They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise
Whether we are Republican or Democrat we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks
Question If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren t they the subject of the investigation Why didn t Obama do something about the meddling Why aren t Dem crimes under investigation Ask Jeff Session

He s got a very good point Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs Clinton s criminality at her own hands or through others that ought to be investigated I fully agree with the President on that on Show
I ve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year I just don t see the evidence in terms of the collusion it s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have Jonathan Turley on
We ve seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION I have seen nothing the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he s exercising his power as the President of the U S I just don t see it Judge Ken Starr

Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign with zero proof of wrongdoing long before the Election in November Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win Unprecedented Bigger than Watergate Plus Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling
It s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA Gave them 6 months they just don t care Where are they We are ready to make a deal
The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House Wrong People will always come amp go and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision I still have some people that I want to change always seeking perfection There is no Chaos only great Energy
Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY Problem is we don t have Stars anymore except your President just kidding of course

The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out Wrong I am VERY happy with my lawyers John Dowd Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow They are doing a great job and
have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia just excuse for losing The only Collusion was that done by the DNC the Democrats and Crooked Hillary The writer of the story Maggie Haberman a Hillary flunky knows nothing about me and is not given access
The Republicans are 5 0 in recent Congressional races a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention I backed and campaigned for all of the winners They give me credit for one Hopefully Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday
The Democrats continue to Obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government A record in U S history State Department Ambassadors and many others are being slow walked Senate must approve NOW
California s sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk Thousands of dangerous amp violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies set free to prey on innocent Americans THIS MUST STOP

As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice amp State DrainTheSwamp
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife s campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation How many lies How many leaks Comey knew it all and much more
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign WITCH HUNT
Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me I don t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date Same with lying James Comey Can we call them Fake Memos
Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats some big Crooked Hillary supporters and Zero Republicans Another Dem recently added does anyone think this is fair And yet there is NO COLLUSION
The Democrats do not want to help DACA Would be so easy to make a deal
Special Council is told to find crimes wether crimes exist or not I was opposed the the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I still am opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because
Special Council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I am still opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because
I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past Obama called him also The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him They are wrong Getting along with Russia and others is a good thing not a bad thing
Got 1 6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border rest will be forthcoming Most importantly got 700 Billion to rebuild our Military 716 Billion next year most ever Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment
Democrats refused to take care of DACA Would have been so easy but they just didn t care I had to fight for Military and start of Wall
Remember when they were saying during the campaign that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary s large and highly sophisticated staff Well not saying that anymore
As a candidate I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade protect American workers and defend our national security Today we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment
My honor Charlie thank you MAGA
House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report FINDINGS 1 No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign amp Russia 2 The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient 3 Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts
DACA was abandoned by the Democrats Very unfair to them Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall
I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats not even mentioned in Bill and the BORDER WALL which is desperately needed for our National Defense is not fully funded
News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill 1 00 P M
Much can be done with the 1 6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall It is just a down payment Work will start immediately The rest of the money will come and remember DACA the Democrats abandoned you but we will not
Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case don t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on Fame amp fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted Problem is that a new
lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed if for no other reason than they can bill more which is unfair to our great country and I am very happy with my existing team Besides there was NO COLLUSION with Russia except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems
President Donald J Trump Proclaims March 25 2018 as Greek Independence Day A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy

Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal Democrat laws like Catch amp Release Getting more dangerous Caravans coming Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW NO MORE DACA DEAL
Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the U S They laugh at our dumb immigration laws They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA NEED WALL
DACA is dead because the Democrats didn t care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon No longer works Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime
Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA They have very strong border laws ours are pathetic With all of the money they make from the U S hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws
So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke

President Trump s approval rate among likely U S voters hit 50 percent on Monday which puts him higher than former President Barack Obama s score at the same point into his first term according to a new poll Via Giaritelli
The Fake News Networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast The Fakers at CNN NBC ABC amp CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction
Check out the fact that you can t get a job at ratings challenged unless you state that you are totally anti Trump Little Jeff Zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting
I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy Amazon should pay these costs plus and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer Many billions of dollars P O leaders don t have a clue or do they

While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA Record clean Air amp Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars Rent was about market rate travel expenses OK Scott is doing a great job
The FBI closed the case on Hillary which was a rigged investigation They exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her they never even put her under oath and much more So true Jesse

The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story It was political pundit Doug Schoen not a Ukrainian businessman who asked me to do a short speech by phone Skype hosted by Doug in Ukraine I was very positive about Ukraine another negative to the Fake Russia C story
So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China the coming North Korea meeting and of course the vicious gas attack in Syria Feels great to have Bolton amp Larry K on board I we are
doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation which takes tremendous time and focus No Collusion or Obstruction other than I fight back so now they do the Unthinkable and RAID a lawyers office for information BAD
Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria Get ready Russia because they will be coming nice and new and smart You shouldn t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it
Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the Cold War There is no reason for this Russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together Stop the arms race
Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake amp Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama Mueller is most conflicted of all except Rosenstein who signed FISA amp Comey letter No Collusion so they go crazy

untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible Director of the FBI His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst botch jobs of history It was my great honor to fire James Comey
We are bringing back our factories we are bringing back our jobs and we are bringing back those four beautiful words MADE IN THE USA
Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling stupidly of the Clinton Email probe In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job Slimeball
Comey throws AG Lynch under the bus Why can t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch Was she promised a Supreme Court seat or AG in order to lay off Hillary No golf and grandkids talk give us all a break
The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term Mission Accomplished I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back Use often
Just hit 50 in the Rasmussen Poll much higher than President Obama at same point With all of the phony stories and Fake News it s hard to believe Thank you America we are doing Great Things
Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her lied in Congress to Senator G then based his decisions on her poll numbers Disgruntled he McCabe and the others committed many crimes
Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U S keeps raising interest rates Not acceptable
Rasmussen just came out at 51 Approval despite the Fake News Media They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News Washington Post and they haven t changed get new pollsters Much of the media is a Scam

If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered many times higher than normal
Follow the money The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia because there was no Collusion He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win just like they did to Bernie Sanders who got duped
New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign Even Clapper worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities

The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party s campaign is different than having a Spy as illegal as that may be But what about an Informant who is paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the Russian Hoax
Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain And to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money LOST
Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs saying that they are individuals amp must be nurtured or asking to end your big Tax Cuts amp raise your taxes instead Dems have lost touch
On behalf of the American People CONGRATULATIONS We love you

Why didn t President Obama do something about the so called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn t want to upset the apple cart He was in charge not me and did nothing

FBI Agent Peter Strzok who headed the Clinton amp Russia investigations texted to his lover Lisa Page in the IG Report that we ll stop candidate Trump from becoming President Doesn t get any lower than that
U S A Jobs numbers are the BEST in 44 years If my opponent the Democrats had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations the economy and jobs would have been a disaster

I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos implying anger of negotiating an agreement where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for
The Fake News Media said that I did not get along with other Leaders at the G7Summit in Canada They are once again WRONG
Great discussions with European Union Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and EU Council President Donald Tusk at the G7Summit in Canada last week
Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation for a change This is why we need more Republicans elected in November Democrats are good at only three things High Taxes High Crime and Obstruction Sad

Funny how the Fake News in a coordinated effort with each other likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I met That s because that s all they have to disparage We got so much for peace in the world amp more is being added in finals Even got our hostages remains
The denuclearization deal with North Korea is being praised and celebrated all over Asia They are so happy Over here in our country some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win even if it does save potentially millions amp millions of lives
Our economy is perhaps BETTER than it has ever been Companies doing really well and moving back to America and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years
Washington Post employees want to go on strike because Bezos isn t paying them enough I think a really long strike would be a great idea Employees would get more money and we would get rid of Fake News for an extended period of time Is a registered lobbyist
WITCH HUNT There was no Russian Collusion Oh I see there was no Russian Collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax Too bad they didn t look at Crooked Hillary like this Double Standard

Why was the FBI s sick loser Peter Strzok working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry amp Conflicted Democrats when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover lawyer Lisa Page that we ll stop Trump from becoming President Witch Hunt
The Democrats should get together with their Republican counterparts and work something out on Border Security amp Safety Don t wait until after the election because you are going to lose
The highest level of bias I ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer Trey Gowdy on the FBI s own Peter Strzok Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller A really sick deal isn t it

It is the Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder Security and Crime Tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by Crime coming from illegal immigration Change the laws
If President Obama who got nowhere with North Korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed had gotten along with North Korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that I have the Fake News would have named him a national hero
Comey gave Strozk his marching orders Mueller is Comey s best friend Witch Hunt
Crime in Germany is up 10 plus officials do not want to report these crimes since migrants were accepted Others countries are even worse Be smart America
Democrats are the problem They don t care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our Country like MS 13 They can t win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters

It s the Democrats fault they won t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation They want open borders which breeds horrible crime Republicans want security But I am working on something it never ends

Major Wall Street Journal opinion piece today talking about the Russian Witch Hunt and the disgrace that it is So many people hurt so bad for our country a total sham Democrats fix the laws Don t

cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country When somebody comes in we must immediately with no Judges or Court Cases bring them back from where they came Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order Most children come without parents Our Immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years Immigration must be based on merit we need people who will help to Make America Great Again The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country remove those Barriers amp Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U S A Trade must be fair and no longer a one way

have been believed The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows badly needs a paint job rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI although I do not legally have to because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on But you do have to ask why the DOJ amp FBI aren t giving over requested documents Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours Actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama Fake News is working overtime Hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go will always be disfunctional People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U S illegally Children brought back to their country If this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in it s tracks and at very little by comparison cost This is the only real answer and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL Will be heading to one of my favorite places South Carolina to fight for one of my original fighters Governor Henry McMaster Speaking at 7 00 P M Congresswoman Maxine Waters an extraordinarily low IQ person has become together with Nancy Pelosi the Face of the Democrat Party She has just called for harm to

fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E U which has hurt us badly on trade down 151 Billion Taxes just a Harley excuse be patient MAGA Director David Lynch Trump Could Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents Why is Senator Mark Warner D VA perhaps in a near drunken state claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt knows Isn t this highly illegal Is it being investigated The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI amp DOJ should be shown to the public on live television not a closed door hearing that nobody will see We should expose these people for what they are there should be total transparency Just landed in South Carolina will be at the McMaster rally shortly MAGA Thank you South Carolina Now let s get out tomorrow and VOTE for Early this year Harley Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand That was long before Tariffs were announced Hence they were just using Tariffs Trade War as an excuse Shows how unbalanced amp unfair trade is but we will fix it We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers workers and companies We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint They must play fair or they will pay tariffs When I had Harley Davidson officials over to the White House I chided them about tariffs in other countries like India being too high Companies are now coming back to America Harley must know that they won t be able to sell back into U S without paying a big tax We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E U in that they have long taken advantage of the U S in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs In the end it will all even out and it won t take very long It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina Henry is tough on Crime and Borders loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN A Harley Davidson should never be built in

for Amazon the Washington Post who constantly quote anonymous sources that in my opinion don t exist They will both be out of business in 7 years Big decision will soon be made on our next Justice of the Supreme Court Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the Special Councel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia so ridiculous that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation amp that the only Collusion was with the Dems Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the Special Counsel because the public

exceptional person will be chosen They just didn t get it but they do now The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country This is not fair nor is it acceptable While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office they must do much more Germany is at 1 the U S is at 4 and NATO benefits Europe far more than it does the U S By some accounts the U S is paying for 90 of NATO with many countries nowhere close to their 2 commitment On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of 151 Million with the U S with big Trade Barriers on U S goods NO I have long heard that the most important decision a U S President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice Will be announced tonight at 9 00 P M I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed amp even more importantly our handshake We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea China on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade Hope Not The failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out The U S strongly supports breast feeding but we don t believe women should be denied access to formula Many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty Pfizer amp others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason They are merely taking advantage of the poor amp others unable to defend themselves while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe amp elsewhere We will respond HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY to our amazing current and former Army Warrant Officers Thank you for your century of service as the indispensable guardians of our great s technology CenturyOfService Tonight it was my honor and privilege to nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court SCOTUS Getting ready to leave for Europe First meeting NATO The U S is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them Not fair to the U S taxpayer On top of that we lose 151 Billion on Trade with the European Union Charge us big Tariffs amp Barriers NATO countries must pay MORE the United States must pay LESS Very Unfair Thank you to all of my great supporters really big progress being made Other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals Economy is ROARING Supreme Court pick getting GREAT REVIEWS New Poll says Trump at over 90 is the most popular Republican in history of the Party Wow On behalf of the United States congratulations to the Thai Navy SEALs and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in Thailand Such a beautiful moment all freed great job I am on Air Force One flying to NATO and hear reports that the FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are getting cold feet on testifying about the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and people that worked for Obama for 8 years Total disgrace Informing the Republican Senators of my nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh SCOTUS Many countries in NATO which we are expected to defend are not only short of their current commitment of 2 which is low but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made Will they reimburse the U S A recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans especially Hispanics feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe U S has a 151 Billion trade deficit and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO and nicely pay for it Just doesn t work Just talked with Pfizer CEO and on our drug pricing blueprint Pfizer is rolling back price hikes so American patients don t pay more We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same Great news for the American people Bilateral Breakfast with NATO Secretary General in Brussels Belgium I am in Brussels but always thinking about our farmers Soy beans fell 50 from 2012 to my election Farmers have done poorly for 15 years Other countries trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses I will open things up better than ever before but it can t go too quickly I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers and will win Democrats in Congress must no longer Obstruct vote to fix our terrible Immigration Laws now I am watching what is going on from Europe it would be soooo simple to fix Judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works They are just using children What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy Why are their only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment The U S is paying for Europe s protection then loses billions on Trade Must pay 2 of GDP IMMEDIATELY not by 2025 What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment The U S is paying for Europe s protection then loses billions on Trade Must pay 2 of GDP IMMEDIATELY not by 2025 If the Democrats want to win Supreme Court and other Court picks don t Obstruct and Resist but rather do it the good ol fashioned way WIN ELECTIONS Ex FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress Wow but is anybody really surprised Together with her lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former FBI Agent Lover Peter Strzok Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year at my request but it isn t nearly enough U S spends too much Europe s borders are BAD Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable As I head out to a very important NATO meeting I see that FBI Lover Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena amp is refusing to show up and testify What can she possibly say about her statements and lies So much corruption on the other side Where is the Attorney General Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia They pay only a fraction of their cost The U S pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe and loses Big on Trade On top of it all Germany just started paying Russia the country they want protection from Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia Not acceptable All NATO Nations must meet their 2 commitment and that must ultimately go to 4 NATOSummit2018 Press Conference in Brussels Belgium Thank you NATO2018 Trump has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment In June for instance the unemployment rate for Hispanics and Latinos 16 years and older fell to 4 6 its lowest level

Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings calls and hopefully some golf my primary form of exercise The weather is beautiful and this place is incredible Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin The Stock Market hit 25000 yesterday Jobs are at an all time record and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government It is all happening The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administrations Why didn t they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election Where is the DNC Server and why didn t the FBI take possession of it Deep State The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administration Why didn t they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election So funny I just checked out Fake News CNN for the first time in a long time they are dying in the ratings to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta actually a nice guy They didn t But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin Fake News Remember it was Little Jeff Z and his people who are told exactly what to say who said I could not win the election in that there was no way to 270 over amp over again in the Electoral College I got 306 They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage Still hurting Our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in Japan We commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years Why didn t Obama do something about it Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win that s why Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration but Fake News doesn t want to report the truth as usual There hasn t been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in North Korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages Who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isn t the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts Because it is FAKE NEWS Heading to Helsinki Finland looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow Unfortunately no matter how well I do at the Summit if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years I would return to criticism that it wasn t good enough that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country but at some point it will heal Congratulations to France who played extraordinary soccer on winning the 2018 World Cup Additionally congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament one of the best ever Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present amp future We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media NATO is now strong amp rich President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling he said it couldn t happen was no big deal amp did NOTHING about it When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U S foolishness and stupidity and now the Rigged Witch Hunt It was an honor to join you this morning Thank you Joint Press Conference from Helsinki Finland Thank you Helsinki Finland As I said today and many times before I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people However I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future we cannot exclusively focus on the past as the world s two largest nuclear powers we must get along HELSINKI2018 I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics HELSINKI2018 A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia but it is good for the world HELSINKI2018 Will be interviewed on tonight at 9pmE and tomorrow night at 8pmE Enjoy Thank you you really get it The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations what s he supposed think I had a great meeting with NATO They have paid 33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future only because of me NATO was weak but now it is strong again bad for Russia The media only says I was rude to leaders never mentions the money While I had a great meeting with NATO raising vast amounts of money I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia Sadly it is not being reported that way the Fake News is going Crazy Thank you The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations what s he supposed to think The economy of the United States is stronger than ever before The meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success except in the Fake News Media The Democrats want to abolish ICE which will mean more crime in our country I want to give ICE a big cheer Vote Republican in November Prosperity is returning Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate now as the most effective president the most successful president in modern American history Thank you to the great Lou Dobbs So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match Big results will come While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with Russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success Many positive things will come out of that meeting Russia has agreed to help with North Korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along There is no rush the sanctions remain Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process Congratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress My endorsement came appropriately late but when it came the flood gates opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve Enjoy A lot of Democrats wished they voted for the Tax Cuts because the economy is booming we could have 4 growth now and the Fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia They would rather go to war than see this It s called Trump Derangement Syndrome 3 4 million jobs created since our great Election Victory far greater than ever anticipated and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia The Primary is on Tuesday Brian is

been held hostage far too long Erdogan should do something to free this wonderful Christian husband amp father He has done nothing wrong and his family needs him Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs Likewise to Pfizer We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices maybe substantially on prescription drugs The Democrats have a death wish in more ways than one they actually want to abolish ICE This should cost them heavily in the Midterms Yesterday the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE The Fake News Media is going Crazy They make up stories without any backup sources or proof Many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction Problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity But I ll complain anyway The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia even a confrontation that could lead to war They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I ll probably have a good relationship with Putin We are doing MUCH better than any other country Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES Thank you to and for actually showing the clips The Fake News wants no part of that narrative Too bad they don t want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set Really big jobs meeting today at the White House 3 P M I told you so The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies Google They truly have taken advantage of the U S but not for long The Summit with Russia was a great success except with the real enemy of the people the Fake News Media I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed including stopping terrorism security for Israel nuclear Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES proliferation cyber attacks trade Ukraine Middle East peace North Korea and more There are many answers some easy and some hard to these problems but they can ALL be solved Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES Will the Dems and Fake News ever learn This is classic My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri Such a tragedy such a great loss May God be with you all China the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the U S is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day taking away our big competitive edge As usual not a level playing field The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well Tightening now hurts all that we have done The U S should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals Debt coming due amp we are raising rates Really Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years The price of soybeans has fallen 50 since 5 years before the Election A big reason is bad terrible Trade Deals with other countries They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers Canada charges 275 on Dairy Farmers will WIN So important Should have been done years ago I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy If I was loud amp vicious I would have been criticized for being too tough Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim Hypocrites The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again can t believe it Isn t it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart The 40000000 Commissioner must now make a stand First time kneeling out for game Second time kneeling out for season no pay Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer s office early in the morning almost unheard of Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client totally unheard of amp perhaps illegal The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong The Rigged Witch Hunt headed by the 13 Angry Democrats and now 4 more have been added one who worked directly for Obama W H seems intent on damaging the Republican Party s chances in the November Election This Democrat excuse for losing the 16 Election never ends No Collusion No Obstruction but that doesn t matter because the 13 Angry Democrats who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing Brian Kemp who is

barricaded suspect L A P D working with Federal Law Enforcement Congratulations to and on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of Justice and FBI misled the courts Witch Hunt Rigged a Scam Looking more amp more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon surveillance for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC Ask her how that worked out she did better with Crazy Bernie Republicans must get tough now An illegal Scam Andrew McCarthy I said this could never happen This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it It is so bad it screams out at you On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt on Source 1 was the Fake Dossier Yes the Dirty Dossier paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump and looking for information that could discredit Candidate 1 Trump Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign ILLEGAL I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it So bad for our country Happy Birthday So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election Why didn t he do something about it Why didn t he tell our campaign Because it is all a big hoax that s why and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win To Iranian President Rouhani NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE amp DEATH BE CAUTIOUS Tom Fitton on at 6 15 A M NOW Judicial Watch So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC that was knowingly amp falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt It was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team This is a Clinton Campaign document It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump and the DOJ FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account Source 1 was the major source Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team Not about Carter Page was all about getting Trump Carter Page wasn t a spy wasn t an agent of the Russians he would have cooperated with the FBI It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump Tom Fitton A disgrace to America They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin and all that I gave up remember I gave up NOTHING we merely talked about future benefits for both countries Also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the Corrupt Media A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months Likewise no Nuclear Tests Japan is happy all of Asia is happy But the Fake News is saying without ever asking me always anonymous sources that I am angry because it is not going fast enough Wrong very happy The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U S Supreme Court two months ago Next up is the U S Post Office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their delivery boy for a BIG percentage of their packages In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive the paper loses a fortune lobbyist for Amazon Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought Robert will do a great job for our Vets We also recently won Choice Lou Barletta was one of my first supporters He is tough on Crime and Borders Will be a great Senator from Pennsylvania His opponent is WEAK on Crime ICE and Borders We need Lou MadeInAmerica Showcase Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate This should have taken place many years ago butas the saying goes better late than never Tariffs are the greatest Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade

Subsidies That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade Hope they do it we are ready but they won t So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved much bigger but not Sinclair Disgraceful The Russia Hoax The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton amp Frame Donald Trump is a Hot Seller already Number One More importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off Lost 817 Billion on Trade last year No weakness When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity Negotiations are going really well be cool The end result will be worth it China is targeting our farmers who they know I love amp respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U S They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt We were being nice until now China made 517 Billion on us last year What kind of a lawyer would tape a client So sad Is this a first never heard of it before Why was the tape so abruptly terminated cut while I was presumably saying positive things I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so Too bad Congratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night Wow 69 30 those are big numbers Now go win against the open border crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you She is weak on Vets the Military and the 2nd Amendment Win The United States and the European

citizens This week my Administration is hosting the first ever IRFMinisterial The U S will continue to promote ReligiousFreedom around the world Nations that support religious freedom are far more free prosperous amp peaceful Great job Ambassador amp Sergio Marchionne who passed away today was one of the most brilliant amp successful car executives since the days of the legendary Henry Ford It was a great honor for me to get to know Sergio as POTUS he loved the car industry and fought hard for it He will be truly missed Thank you very much working hard Great meeting on Trade today with and representatives of the European Union We have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs no barriers and no subsidies Work on documents has already started and the process is moving along quickly European Union Nations will be open to the United States and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them There was great warmth and feeling in the room a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible Obviously the European Union as represented by and the United States as represented by yours truly love each other Thank you Georgia They say that my endorsement last week of Brian Kemp in the Republican Primary for Governor against a very worthy opponent lifted him from 5 points down to a 70 to 30 victory Two very good and talented men in a great race but congratulations to Brian Great to be back on track with the European Union This was a big day for free and fair trade European Union representatives told me that they

innocent man of faith should be released immediately Thank you S Steel and Granite City Illinois PROMISES KEPT a brilliant lawyer who although a Liberal Democrat who probably didn t vote for me has discussed the Witch Hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way He has written a new and very important book called The Case Against Impeaching Trump which I would encourage all people with Trump Derangement Syndrome to read America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS and U S Steel is back The Remains of American Servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the United States After so many years this will be a great moment for so many families Thank you to Kim Jong Un Way to go Jerry This is what the league should do Arrived back in Washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major U S Steel plant in Granite City Illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted Robert Mueller and his gang of 13 Angry Democrats obviously cannot find Collusion the only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats so now they are looking at my Tweets along with 53 million other people the rigged Witch Hunt continues How stupid and unfair to our Country And so the Fake News doesn t waste my time with dumb questions NO I did NOT know of the meeting with my son Don jr Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get

52 Billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for African Americans Hispanics Asians and Women I would be willing to shut down government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security which includes the Wall Must get rid of Lottery Catch amp Release etc and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT We need great people coming into our Country When the media driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome reveals internal deliberations of our government it truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk Very unpatriotic Freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news accurately 90 of media coverage of my Administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving it s no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low I will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti Trump haters in the dying newspaper industry No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people As an example the failing New York Times and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements and they will never change There is No Collusion The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt headed now by 17 increased

did they just want to use Page as an excuse to SPY Jenna Ellis FBI thought they wouldn t get caught because they thought that Hillary was going to win There is overt bias and that depends on whether you are Democrat or Republican a double standard that needs to stop No evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians and here we are a year

bad move U S will soon have a level playing field or better Seems like the Department of Justice and FBI had a program to keep Donald Trump from becoming President If this had happened to the other side everybody involved would be in jail This is a Media coverup of the biggest story of our time Wacky Omarosa who got fired 3 times on the Apprentice now got fired for the last time She never made it never will She begged me for a job tears in her eyes I said Ok People in the White House hated her She was vicious but not smart I would rarely see her but heard really bad things Nasty to people amp would constantly miss meetings amp work When Gen Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser amp nothing but problems I told him to try working it out if possible because she only said GREAT things about me until she got fired While I know it s not presidential to take on a lowlife like Omarosa and while I would rather not be doing so this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible Sorry The very unpopular Governor of Ohio and failed presidential candidate hurt Troy Balderson s recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate Even Kasich s Lt Governor lost Gov race because of his unpopularity Credit to Troy on the BIG WIN Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI finally The list of bad players in the FBI amp DOJ gets longer amp longer Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt will it be dropped It is a total Hoax No Collusion No Obstruction I just fight back Just fired Agent Strzok formerly of the FBI was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone Wacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non Disclosure Agreement Brooks Koepka just won his third Golf Major and he did it not only with his powerful game but with his

quotes saying such wonderful and powerful things about me a true Champion of Civil Rights until she got fired Omarosa had Zero credibility with the Media they didn t want interviews when she worked in the White House Now that she says bad about me they will talk to her Fake News Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch The Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok amp his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI We know this guy was corrupt and had anti Trump animus Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation Instead Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong He used Strzok he used the Clinton DNC Dossier the whole thing should be shut down The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors Thank you Judicial Watch I couldn t have said it better myself Lou Dobbs This cannot go forward this Special Councel with all of his conflicts with his 17 Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia The Dems are the ones who should be investigated Thank you Lou so true When you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the White House I guess it just didn t work out Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog Another terrorist attack in London These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength Bruce Ohr of the Justice Department can you believe he is still there is accused of helping disgraced Christopher Steele find dirt on Trump Ohr s wife Nelly was in on the act big time worked for Fusion GPS on Fake Dossier They were all in on it clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didn t do Gregg Jarrett on If we had a real Attorney General this Witch Hunt would never have been started Looking at the wrong people Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia and everybody including the Democrats know it The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary the Democrats and the DNC Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt why isn t this so called probe ended immediately Why aren t these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary Lou Dobbs This cannot go forward this Special Counsel with all of his conflicts with his 17 Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia The Dems are the ones who should be investigated Thank you Lou so true Hope and Change in an Alabama Coal Mine Great

Department amp whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok This is too crazy to be believed The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility While Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch Catherine Herridge of In other words they were colluding with Russia Very concerned about Comey s firing afraid they will be exposed said Bruce Ohr DOJ s Emails amp Notes show Bruce Ohr s connection to phony amp discredited Trump Dossier A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act Rigged Witch Hunt speaking of John Brennan How did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place Now that is a really good question Then followed by Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero So true a total Fake How can Senator Richard Blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam pass judgement on anyone Loser An incredibly corrupt FBI amp DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election Brennan has gone off the deep end he s disgraced and discredited himself His conduct has been outrageous Chris Farrell Judicial Watch Director Brennan s recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power If Director Brennan s statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the CIA why didn t he include it in the Intelligence Community Assessment released in 2017 If his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office it constitutes an intelligence breach Richard Burr R NC Senate Intel Cmte Chair In speaking with some of the world s top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business jobs even better in the U S Stop quarterly reporting amp go to a six month system said one That would allow greater flexibility amp save money I have asked the SEC to study How does a politician Cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the U S survive making the statement WE RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT Which section of the sentence is worse The local politicians who run Washington D C poorly know a windfall when they see it When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it Never let someone hold you up I will instead attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date amp go to the Paris parade celebrating the end of the War on November 11th Maybe we will do something next year in D C when the cost comes WAY DOWN Now we can buy some more jet fighters Just announced youth unemployment is at a 50 year low The U S has more than double the growth rate than it had 18 months ago Wow Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America s lack of greatness I have already MADE America Great Again just look at the markets jobs military setting records and we will do even better Andrew chocked badly mistake Wow Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America s lack of greatness I have already MADE America Great Again just look at the markets jobs military setting records and we will do even better Andrew choked badly mistake When a politician admits that We re not going to make America great again there doesn t seem to be much reason to ever vote for him This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo with many wanting him to resign he will get higher ratings than his brother Chris Which is worse Hightax Andrew Cuomo s statement WE RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT or Hillary Clinton s DEPLORABLES statement I say Andrew s was a bigger and more incompetent blunder He should easily win his race against a Super Liberal Actress but his political career is over Fox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti Trump Russia probe will be exposed Charles Payne How much more does Mueller have to see They have blinders on

getting fatter amp fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling He doesn t disclose it under Fed Regs Using your Federal office for personal financial gain is a Federal Gratuity Statute Violation Bribery Statute Violation Honest Services Violation all Major Crimes because the DOJ is run by BLANK Jeff Sessions Gregg Jarrett So when does Mueller do what must be done Probably never Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican Conservative voices Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration we won t let that happen They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT while at the same time doing nothing to others Censorship is a very dangerous thing amp absolutely impossible to police If you are weeding out Fake News there is nothing so Fake as CNN amp MSNBC amp yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or don t watch at all Too many voices are being destroyed some good amp some bad and that cannot be allowed to happen Who is making the choices because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made Let everybody participate good amp bad and we will all just have to figure it out All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction China But in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director He will go down as easily the WORST in history amp since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country Great Job Rachel Campos Duffy on The Economy is stronger and better than ever before Importantly there remains tremendous potential it will only get better with time The United States has ended the ridiculous 230 Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the U S I want to develop the U S our military and countries that help us I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Councel In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents Most transparent in history No Collusion No Obstruction Witch Hunt I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents Most transparent in history No Collusion No Obstruction Witch Hunt The failing wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel he must be a John Dean type RAT But I allowed him and all others to testify I didn t have to I have nothing to hide and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close So many lives have been ruined over nothing McCarthyism at its WORST Yet Mueller amp his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side Media is even worse No Collusion and No Obstruction except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats All of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction What about the Brennan Comey McCabe Strzok lies to Congress or Crooked s Emails The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President when in fact it is just the opposite amp the two Fake reporters knew this This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People So bad for America Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times They actually called to complain and apologize a big step forward From the day I announced the Times has been Fake News and with their disgusting new Board Member it will only get worse Study the late Joseph McCarthy because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby Rigged Witch Hunt Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone looking for trouble They are enjoying ruining people s lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side the lies the firings the deleted Emails and soooo much more Mueller s Angry Dems are looking to impact the election They are a National Disgrace Where s the Collusion They made up a phony crime called Collusion and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction of a phony crime that never existed If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt they scream Obstruction I hope John Brennan the worst CIA Director in our country s history brings a lawsuit It will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt He won t sue Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance it s worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan It certainly isn t because of the good job he did He is a political hack Will Bruce Ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited Dossier ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions Justice Department A total joke Bruce Ohr is at the center of FALSE ALLEGATIONS which led to a multi million dollar

under tremendous pressure from China because of our major trade disputes with the Chinese Government At the same time we also know that China is providing North Korea with considerable aid including money fuel fertilizer and various other commodities This is not helpful Nonetheless the President believes that his relationship with Kim Jong Un is a very good and warm one and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts of money on joint U S South Korea war games Besides the President can instantly start the joint exercises again with South Korea and Japan if he so chooses If he does they will be far bigger than ever before As for the U S China trade disputes and other differences they will be resolved in time by President Trump and China s great President Xi Jinping Their relationship and bond remain very strong CNN is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake Sloppy a man who lives in the past and thinks

in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico When I left the Island AFTER the storm had hit they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths As time went by it did not go up by much Then a long time later they started to report really large numbers like 3000 This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico If a person died for any reason like old age just add them onto the list Bad politics I love Puerto Rico The Wall Street Journal has it wrong we are under no pressure to make a deal with China

proper credit for this great Midterm Election just remember two words FAKE NEWS If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information and much else at the Senate level Two can play that game In all fairness Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats If they give her a hard time perhaps we will add some Republican votes She has earned this great honor According to NBC News Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the so called Mueller Investigation 46 more than they Approve 41 You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt led by 17 Angry Democrats is all about We are pleased to announce that Matthew G Whitaker Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States He will serve our Country well We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service and wish him well A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date I have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in

Beach Florida voted for Rick Scott Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States ran a great race in Georgia he won It is time to move on You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia but the Election was on Tuesday Let s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer Marc Elias to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes Don t worry Florida I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD Jeff Flake y doesn t want to protect the Non Senate confirmed Special Counsel he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the crime of doing a terrible job A weak and ineffective guy Rick Scott was up by 50000 votes on Election Day now they found many votes and he is only up 15000 votes The Broward Effect How come they never find Republican votes Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him back into play Bill Nelson conceded Election now he s back in play This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a number couldn t do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory Thank you for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties The WORLD is now watching closely Just out in Arizona SIGNATURES DON T MATCH Electoral corruption Call for a new Election We must protect our Democracy President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U S China and Russia Very insulting but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO which the U S subsidizes greatly Matthew G Whitaker is a highly respected former U S Attorney from Iowa He was chosen by Jeff Sessions to be his Chief of Staff I did not know Mr Whitaker Likewise as Chief I did not know Mr Whitaker except primarily as he traveled with A G Sessions No social contact Mr Whitaker is very highly thought of by Senator Ambassador Leonard Leo of Federalist Society and many more I feel certain he will make an outstanding Acting Attorney General There is no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor Billions of dollars are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forests Remedy now or no more Fed payments I am in Paris getting ready to celebrate the end of World War One Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war in particular that one which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time Happy 243rd Birthday to our GREAT U S Marine Corps Had very productive meetings and calls for our Country today Meeting tonight with World Leaders Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida We are watching closely More than 4000 are fighting the Camp and Woolsey Fires in California that have burned over 170000 acres Our hearts are with those fighting the fires the 52000 who have evacuated and the families of the 11 who have died The destruction is catastrophic God Bless them all These California fires are expanding very very quickly in some cases 80 100 acres a minute If people don t evacuate quickly they risk being overtaken by the fire Please listen to evacuation orders from State and local officials With proper Forest Management we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California Get Smart On this Veterans Day the 100th Anniversary of the end of WWI we honor the brave HEROES who fought for America in the Great War and every Veteran who has worn the uniform and kept our Nation Safe Strong and FREE Beautiful ceremony today in Paris commemorating the end of World War One Many World leaders

100th Anniversary of your Independence I will never forget my time there Exactly 100 years ago today on November 11th 1918 World War I came to an end We are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle Just returned from France where much was accomplished in my meetings with World Leaders Never easy bringing up the fact that the U S must be treated fairly which it hasn t on both Military and Trade We pay for LARGE portions of other countries military protection hundreds of billions of dollars for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade I told them that this situation cannot continue It is and always has been ridiculously unfair to the United States Massive amounts of money spent on protecting other countries and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection or protect themselves and Trade must be made FREE and FAIR The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere and many ballots are missing or forged An honest vote count is no longer possible ballots massively infected Must go with Election Night The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches The California Fire Fighters FEMA and First Responders are amazing and very brave Thank you and God Bless you all American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws These guys are acting much worse and have much more potential for damage to consumers than anything AT amp T Time Warner would do Charlie Gasparino Hopefully Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production Oil prices should be much lower based on supply I just approved an expedited request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of California Wanted to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on I am with you all the way God Bless all of the victims and families affected Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U S China and Russia But it was Germany in World Wars One amp Two How did that work out for France They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U S came along Pay for NATO or not On Trade France makes excellent wine but so does the U S The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U S to sell its wines into France and charges big Tariffs whereas the U S makes it easy for French wines and charges very small Tariffs Not fair must change The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France 26 and an unemployment rate of almost 10 He was just trying to get onto another subject By the way there is no country more Nationalist than France very proud people and rightfully so MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN By the way when the helicopter couldn t fly to the first cemetery in France because of almost zero visibility I suggested driving Secret

found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts They are screaming and shouting at people horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want They are a disgrace to our Nation and don t care how many lives the ruin These are Angry People including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller who worked for Obama for 8 years They won t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY Universities will someday study what highly conflicted and NOT Senate approved Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy

Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts but you do indeed have Obama judges and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an independent judiciary but if it is why are so many opposing view on Border and Safety cases filed there and why are a vast number of those cases overturned Please study

security and the safety of our citizens is putting our country in great danger Not good 79 of these decisions have been overturned in the 9th Circuit A terrible costly and dangerous disgrace It has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays Much talk over dividing up the 9th Circuit into 2 or 3 Circuits Too big Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL

guaranteed result Judges must not Legislate Security and Safety at the Border or anywhere else They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe Our great Law Enforcement professionals MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB If not there will be only bedlam chaos injury and death We want the Constitution as written Will be speaking with our great military in different parts of the world through

is the coldest weather in the history of the Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC and one of the coldest Thanksgivings on record Our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the Border because of the Judicial Activism and Interference by the 9th Circuit Nevertheless they are working hard to make America a safer place though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins Republicans and Democrats MUST come together finally with a major Border Security package which will include funding for the Wall After 40 years of talk it is finally time for action Fix the Border for once and for all NOW Really good Criminal Justice Reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support Mitch McConnell and have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country Already past with big vote in House Would be a major victory for ALL Really good Criminal Justice Reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support Mitch McConnell and have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country Already passed with big vote in House Would be a major victory for ALL I am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by Secretary The FAKE NEWS likes to write stories to the contrary quoting phony sources or jealous people but they aren t true They never like to ask me for a quote b c it would kill their story Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court We only will allow those who come into our Country legally Other than that our very strong policy is Catch and Detain No Releasing into the U S All will stay in Mexico If for any reason it becomes necessary we will CLOSE our Southern Border There is no way that the United States will after decades of abuse put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore Victor Davis Hanson was a very good and interesting guest of Mark Levin on He wrote a highly touted book called The Second World Wars and a new book will soon be coming out called The Case For Trump Recommend both I will be in Gulfport and Tupelo Mississippi on Monday night doing two Rallies for Senator Hyde Smith who has a very important Election on Tuesday She is an outstanding person who is strong on the Border Crime Military our great Vets Healthcare amp the 2nd A Needed in D C The large and violent French protests don t take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection Both of these topics must be remedied soon Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border or if originating countries would not let them form it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U S No longer Dems created this problem No crossings So great that oil prices are falling thank you President T Add that which is like a big Tax Cut to our other good Economic news Inflation down are you listening Fed Mississippi Vote for on Tuesday Respected by all We need her in Washington Thanks General Anthony Tata President Trump is a man of his word amp he said he was going to be tough on the Border and he is tough on the Border He has rightfully strengthened the Border in the face of an unprecedented threat It s the right move by President Trump Thanks General Europe has to pay their fair share for Military Protection The European Union for many years has taken advantage of us on Trade and then they don t live up to their Military commitment through NATO Things must change fast Clinton Foundation donations drop 42 which shows that they illegally played the power game They monetized their political influence through the Foundation During her tenure the State Department was put in the service of the Clinton Foundation Andrew McCarthy did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration In fact a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad cruel we are but it was in 2014 during O years Obama separated children from parents as did Bush etc because that is the policy and law I tried to keep them together but the problem is when you do that vast numbers of additional people storm the Border So with Obama seperation is fine but with Trump it s not Fake 60 Minutes Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants many of whom are stone cold criminals back to their countries Do it by plane do it by bus do it anyway you want but they are NOT coming into the U S A We will close the Border permanently if need be Congress fund the WALL When Mueller does his final report will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble will he be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those on the other side whatever happened to Podesta and will he be putting in statements from hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met saw or spoke to a Russian during this period So many campaign workers people inside from the beginning ask me why they have not been called they want to be There was NO Collusion amp Mueller knows it On the ten year anniversary of the Mumbai terror attack the U S stands with the people of India in their quest for justice The attack killed 166 innocents including six Americans We will never let terrorists win or even come close to winning While CNN doesn t do great in the United States based on ratings outside of the U S they have very little competition Throughout the world CNN has a powerful voice portraying the United States in an unfair and false way Something has to be done including the possibility of the United States starting our own Worldwide Network to show the World the way we really are GREAT Brad Raffensperger will be a fantastic Secretary of State for Georgia will work closely with It is really important that you get out and vote for Brad early voting starts today election is on December 4th is tough on Crime and Borders Loves our Military and Vets He will be great for jobs The Phony Witch Hunt continues but Mueller and his gang of Angry Dems are only looking at one side not the other Wait until it comes out how horribly amp viciously they are treating people ruining lives for them refusing to lie Mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue The Fake News Media builds Bob Mueller up as a Saint when in actuality he is the exact opposite He is doing TREMENDOUS damage to our Criminal Justice System where he is only looking at one side and not the other Heroes will come of this and it won t be Mueller and his terrible Gang of Angry Democrats Look at their past and look where they come from The now 30000000 Witch Hunt continues and they ve got nothing but ruined lives Where is the Server Let these terrible people go back to the Clinton Foundation and Justice Department Polls are open in Mississippi We need Cindy Hyde Smith in Washington GO OUT AND VOTE Thanks Very disappointed with General Motors and their CEO Mary Barra for closing plants in Ohio Michigan and Maryland Nothing being closed in Mexico amp China The U S saved General Motors and this is the THANKS we get We are now looking at cutting all subsidies including for electric cars General Motors made a big China bet years ago when they built plants there and in Mexico don t think that bet is going to pay off I am here to protect America s Workers The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace They are looking at supposedly stolen Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails even though they don t want to look at the DNC Server but have no interest in the Emails that Hillary DELETED amp acid washed AFTER getting a Congressional Subpoena Brenda Snipes in charge of voting in Broward County Florida was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 I VOTED signs on it Just kidding she is a fine very honorable and highly respected voting tactician Congratulations to Senator Cindy Hyde Smith on your big WIN in the Great State of Mississippi We are all very proud of you While the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts amp they will get relief This is our Joseph McCarthy Era The reason that the small truck business in the U S is such a go to favorite is that for many years Tariffs of 25 have been put on small trucks coming into our country It is called the chicken tax If we did that with cars coming in many more cars would be built here and G M would not be closing their plants in Ohio Michigan amp Maryland Get smart Congress Also the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the U S for decades The President has great power on this issue Because of the G M event it is being studied now Steel Dynamics announced that it will build a brand new 3 million ton steel mill in the Southwest that will create 600 good paying U S JOBS Steel JOBS are coming back to America just like I predicted Congratulations to Steel Dynamics On behalf of Melania and the entire Trump family I want to wish you all a very MERRY CHRISTMAS May this Christmas Season bring peace to your hearts warmth to your homes cheer to your spirits and JOY TO THE WORLD NCTL2018 Sebastian Gorka a very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House has just written an excellent book Why We Fight Much will be learned from this very good read So much happening with the now discredited Witch Hunt This total Hoax will be studied for years General Motors is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country Auto companies are pouring into the U S including BMW which just announced a major new plant The U S A is booming Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime At the same time Mueller and the Angry Democrats aren t even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats A total disgrace When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end or will it just go on forever After wasting more than 40000000 is that possible it has proven only one thing there was NO Collusion with Russia So Ridiculous Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the U S A because of the Tariffs being charged to China and there is a long way to go If companies don t want to pay Tariffs build in the U S A Otherwise lets just make our Country richer than ever before Based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting in Argentina with President Vladimir Putin I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved has written an absolutely fascinating book BACK IN THE GAME on the world of D C politics and more He has experienced so much in a short period of time Few people have had his bravery or courage and he has come all the way back A big power and great person and Arthur Laffer two very talented men have just completed an incredible book on my Economic Policies or as they call it TRUMPONOMICS They have really done a great job in capturing my long held views and ideas This book is on sale now a terrific read of a really interesting subject s new book Spygate The
